# attenuation-modelling

This repo contains some tools for modelling complex elastic tensors for aligned fluid-filled fractures. This allows us to model attenaution as well as velocity. Details on the rock physics models can be found in Hudson (1984) and Chapman (2003).

For examples on how some of these tools can be used please see the supplementary notebook for this paper on Zenodo https://zenodo.org/records/10641152

Further work to improve the usability of this code is ongoing...
